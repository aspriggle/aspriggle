# 💖🎉🌸 Pink-loving Christian coder on a mission! 🌸 🎉💖
Hey there! I'm Ashley, a passionate coder with a penchant for pink and a heart filled with faith. My journey from detective work 🔍 to digital solutions 💻 has been an exciting fusion of Barbie dreams and faith-filled endeavors. Overcoming dyslexia along the way, I've been learning languages like Java, C#, and beyond, diving into projects that streamline processes and drive results.

Currently, you can find me crafting code that blends grace and glam, infusing each project with a touch of charm✨. Let's collaborate and create something truly special! 🎉 Follow me for inspiring content, or reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
