Hey there! I'm Ashley, a passionate coder with a penchant for pink and a heart filled with faith. My journey from detective work to digital solutions has been an exciting fusion of dreams and faith-filled endeavors. Overcoming dyslexia along the way, I've been learning languages like Java, C#, and more, diving into projects that streamline processes and yield results.

Currently, you can find me crafting code that blends grace and glam, infusing each project with a touch of charm. Let's collaborate and create something truly special! Follow me for inspiring content, or reach out to discuss potential collaborations.

Professionally, I'm a dedicated software development student at Dakota County Technical College, set to graduate in Spring 2025 with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Software Development and a PC Technician Certificate. My coursework has equipped me with a robust understanding of operating systems, networking, database systems, IT security, web programming, Java, data structures, and computer forensics.
