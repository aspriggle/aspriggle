About Me
I'm a dynamic and adaptable individual whose journey into software development began in an unconventional manner. Starting as a teenage private investigator, I cultivated strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Transitioning through roles in retail, hospitality, and victim advocacy, I gained invaluable experience in communication, empathy, and advocacy.

Driven by a passion for technology and a desire to make a difference, I embarked on a new chapter during the COVID-19 pandemic, seizing the opportunity to pursue coding as a career. As a dyslexic learner, I've overcome obstacles with determination, proving that disabilities do not limit one's potential.

In my current role as a student software developer, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth. Proficient in Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm actively involved in collaborative projects, including a travel planner application developed with a team of peers.

My approach to coding combines creativity, problem-solving, and a commitment to excellence. I thrive in team environments, drawing on my background in victim advocacy to communicate effectively and collaborate towards shared goals.

I'm eager to contribute my diverse skills and experiences to a forward-thinking team, where I can leverage technology to create innovative solutions and positively impact the lives of others.
