Hey there! I'm Ashley, a passionate coder with a penchant for pink and a heart filled with faith. My journey from detective work to digital solutions has been an exciting fusion of dreams and faith-filled endeavors. Overcoming dyslexia along the way, I've been learning languages like Java, C#, and more, diving into projects that streamline processes and yield results.

Currently, you can find me crafting code that blends grace and glam, infusing each project with a touch of charm. Let's collaborate and create something truly special! Follow me for inspiring content, or reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
